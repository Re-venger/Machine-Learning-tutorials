# 📘 Machine Learning Learnings

This repository contains my personal learnings and practice work in **Machine Learning**, organized in Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) format.  
It serves as a collection of experiments, notes, and implementations as I progress through different ML concepts.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks covering various ML topics.
- Each notebook focuses on a specific concept, algorithm, or dataset.

---

## 🚀 Topics Covered (so far)
- Basics of Python for ML
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Supervised learning (Regression, Classification)
- Unsupervised learning (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)
- Model evaluation and metrics
- Experimentation with real-world datasets

*(More will be added as I continue learning.)*
